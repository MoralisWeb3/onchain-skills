# Moralis Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Moralis capabilities, pricing, and implementation.

## General Questions

### What is Moralis?

Moralis is an enterprise-grade Web3 data infrastructure platform. It provides APIs to query blockchain data (balances, tokens, NFTs, transactions, prices) and monitor real-time events across 50+ chains.

**Not a blockchain.** Moralis reads data from blockchains but doesn't host one.

**Not a wallet.** Moralis provides data to build wallets, not wallet services.

### Who uses Moralis?

Major crypto companies including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, Blockchain.com, Ronin Wallet, and Exodus. Powers 100M+ end users monthly.

### Is Moralis free?

Yes, there's a free tier with 40,000 Compute Units per day. Enough for development and small apps. Paid plans start at $49/month.

Full list: [SupportedApisAndChains.md](../moralis-data-api/references/SupportedApisAndChains.md)

### Does Moralis support testnet?

Yes. Major testnets supported:
- Ethereum Sepolia, Holesky
- Polygon Amoy
- BSC Testnet
- Base Sepolia
- And others

Note: Price data not available on testnets.

## Real-Time & Streams

### What's the difference between Data API and Streams?

| Aspect | Data API | Streams |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Model | Request-response | Push via webhook |
| Use | Query current/historical state | React to events |
| Latency | 100-500ms per request | 1-3s after block |
| Setup | API calls | Webhook endpoint required |

### Can I monitor wallets in real-time?

Yes, use @moralis-streams-api. Create a stream with the wallet address and receive webhooks for:
- Incoming/outgoing transactions
- Token transfers
- NFT transfers
- Contract interactions

### Does Streams guarantee delivery?

Yes. 100% delivery guarantee with:
- Automatic retries on failure
- Payload backup for replay
- No event loss

### Can I get historical events from Streams?

Streams are for real-time events only. For historical data:
- Use @moralis-data-api queries
- Or Datashare for bulk export

## Pricing & Limits

### What are Compute Units (CUs)?

CUs measure API usage. Each endpoint costs different CUs based on complexity:
- Simple queries: 1-5 CUs
- Complex queries: 10-50 CUs
- Heavy queries: 50-100+ CUs

### What are the rate limits?

| Plan | Throughput |
|------|------------|
| Free | 1,000 CU/s |
| Starter | 1,000 CU/s |
| Pro | 2,000 CU/s |
| Business | 5,000 CU/s |
| Enterprise | Custom |

### What happens when I exceed limits?

- **Daily limit (Free):** API returns 429 until next day
- **Monthly limit (Paid):** Overage charges apply
- **Throughput:** Requests queued/delayed

### Can I pay with crypto?

Contact Moralis support for crypto payment options.

## Technical Questions

### What's the API authentication?

Single API key in header:
```
X-API-Key: your_api_key
```

Get key at: https://admin.moralis.com

### What format are responses?

JSON. All responses use `snake_case` field names:
```json
{
  "token_address": "0x...",
  "block_number": 12345678
}
```

### How do I handle pagination?

Most list endpoints return max 100 items. Use cursor:
```
?limit=100&cursor=<cursor_from_response>
```

### Are there SDKs?

Yes, official SDKs for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python

But these skills use direct REST API calls via curl for simplicity.

### Is there a webhook secret?

Yes, for Streams webhooks. Different from API key:
- **API Key:** Authenticates your requests to Moralis
- **Streams Secret:** Verifies webhook payloads are from Moralis

## Common Issues

### "404 Not Found" error

Causes:
- Wrong base URL (Data API vs Streams)
- Incorrect endpoint path
- Token/contract doesn't exist

### "401 Unauthorized" error

Causes:
- Missing or invalid API key
- Key not activated yet (takes a few minutes)

### "429 Too Many Requests" error

Causes:
- Exceeded rate limit
- Exceeded daily/monthly quota

Solution: Implement exponential backoff, upgrade plan if needed.

### Empty response

Not an error. The address may have no activity. Check:
- Correct chain ID
- Address has activity on that chain
- Try `getWalletActiveChains` first

### Wrong data types

Common mistakes:
- Block numbers are decimal, not hex
- Balances are strings, not numbers
- Timestamps are ISO strings

See [DataTransformations.md](../moralis-data-api/references/DataTransformations.md)

## Integration Questions

### Can I use Moralis with any backend?

Yes. REST APIs work with any language/framework:
- Node.js
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- PHP

### Can I use Moralis serverless?

Yes. Perfect for:
- AWS Lambda

### How do I handle multi-chain?

2. Query each chain in parallel
3. Aggregate results
